# Motivation to start blogging

{:.post-content__text}
Like many other newbies before they start learning front-end development I asked myself how to start and what is more efficient way towards becoming a developer. Today, the Internet is full of various tutorials, screencasts on how better to get started in the industry. So I started searching for something like “How to start in front-end developer”, “how to become a front-end developer” etc, looking at some tutorials, websites of various developers and so on. Now, after some researching I want to discuss about my findings and briefly overview the way I’ve chosen, and also talk about what else I’m gonna do in this blog.

So, like I said before, I started searching for advices how to get started in the industry. A lot of them recommend doing more practice by building something like portfolio website, to-do apps and so on. However, most of them do not reveal the whole picture and don’t give a full understanding of the subject.

And then I found two articles that got my attention straight away. First on [Medium](http://medium.com) called
[From Zero to Front-end Hero](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.3puc6vtk9) by
[Jonathan Z. White](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/@JonathanZWhite) who is experienced developer and designer. In his article Jonathan discusses and shows methods which he used to use early in his career. He shares systematic approach to the problem, showing
where to start, what sources better to use which lets you understand front-end development properly. The second article I found is from [Philip Walton's](https://philipwalton.com/) personal blog which is literally called [How to become a great Front-end Engineer](https://philipwalton.com/articles/how-to-become-a-great-front-end-engineer/). Philip reveals some mistakes young developers do in their learning and shows some methods which I found very useful. Actually, while reading the article I literally saw myself in his words doing all the wrong stuff in my learning process. Two of the most interesting points in his article are about spending time on understanding how things actually work in web. And the second is to write about what you learn. In his opinion explaining the subject forces one to better understand it and that's why reinforce the learning process.

So this is the way I've chosen to learn front-end development and programming in general. In this blog I'll try to explain some fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Moreover, I'll do some articles about some key programming concepts in C++. And hopefully it will force me understand the subject more deeply. I don't my blog become popular and that kinda stuff but you are very welcome to read me and leave comments. I would be very thankful if would help with my learning. Cheers :)
